# Url Simplifier
A fully featured url shortener. Free and open source. Dockerized to be modular and scalable.

## Features
I'd build this because the features of the current redirect builders (bit.ly, goo.gl, TinyURL, YOURLS, etc, etc...) wheren't enought for me. This url shortening system includes all this:
* Allow permanent or temporary redirections (*permanent* are cacheable by the browser, they perform better but you lose tracking of the hits)
* Customizable aliases or autogenerated aliases
* User and Password protected redirections
* Expirable redirections
* Direct connection with Google Analytics for the trackng of your redirects
* Shareable redirections (you can post them in the social networks and it will share custom metadata)
* Responsive and simple control panel interface that you can use wherever you need it
* Easy to install anywhere
* And many more things that I still working though the [issues](https://github.com/Guisardo/url-simplifier/issues) section, feel free to add your feature request there

## Setup
My intention is that this project should be easily deployed and scaled. You have the choice of install it the hard way or install it the simple way.

### Simple installation
Using [Docker](http://docker.io/) you can deploy this anywhere you want using only the file [/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Guisardo/url-simplifier/raw/master/docker-compose.yml).
* Make sure you have Docker successfully installed
* Download the file [/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Guisardo/url-simplifier/raw/master/docker-compose.yml) anywhere you want.
* Open a docker console (shell or powershell) and go to the folder where you downloaded de .yml file.
* Execute docker-compose like so:
>docker-compose up -d
* See if everything is running navigating with a web-browser to http://{{your-docker}}/healthcheck

### Advance installation
This system only requires a connection to a MongoDB database and a server with PHP7.
But there are some thing to considere it you need a custom installation:
* The system relies on a few rewrites. Currently those rewrites are managed by the /web/.htaccess and /web/admin/.htaccess files. If your server doen't support .htaccess files, you will have to convert the rewrites to the ones that your server supports. It will help a lot if you could make the pull request with the conversions.
* The system reads the hostname and the port of the MongoDB from the environment variables **MONGO_HOSTNAME** and **MONGO_HOSTPORT**.

## Usage
The control panel is accesible using */admin*.
Make sure that you visit the **Security** section of the control panel to set up a password for this administrative interface.

## Contributions
I'll love some help to improve this project.
